# Anagram solver

This program was written as a way to learn rust. This is my first project in rust.

This program can process a txt file of words into a prefix tree that can then be searched rapidly for anagrams of a given set of letters.

words_alpha.txt was retrieved from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words
